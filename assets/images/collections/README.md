# Collection images

The app reads collection artwork from `data.js`. Each collection can define:

- `iconImage` for circular collection icons.
- `bannerImage` for the collection page / Focus Mode banner.
- Optional `bannerImages` fallback list when legacy filenames should continue working.

## Expected icon paths

Upload collection icons to:

- `assets/images/collections/icons/morning-icon.png`
- `assets/images/collections/icons/evening-icon.png`
- `assets/images/collections/icons/before-sleep-icon.png`
- `assets/images/collections/icons/travel-icon.png`
- `assets/images/collections/icons/weather-icon.png`
- `assets/images/collections/icons/prayer-icon.png`
- `assets/images/collections/icons/istikharah-icon.png`

Icons are displayed through circular containers with `object-fit: cover`, so square source images work best.

## Expected banner paths

Upload collection banners to:

- `assets/images/collections/banners/home-banner.png`
- `assets/images/collections/banners/morning-adhkar-banner.png`
- `assets/images/collections/banners/evening-adhkar-banner.png`
- `assets/images/collections/banners/before-sleep-banner.png`
- `assets/images/collections/banners/travel-banner.png`
- `assets/images/collections/banners/weather-banner.png`
- `assets/images/collections/banners/prayer-banner.png`
- `assets/images/collections/banners/istikharah-banner.png`

If a configured banner cannot be loaded, the app falls back to the default gradient/banner styling. Morning, Evening, and Before Sleep also keep legacy filename fallbacks where available.

## Adding future collections

1. Add the collection data to `window.DUAA_COLLECTIONS` in `data.js`.
2. Set `hasTracker: true` only for daily habit collections.
3. Set `hasTracker: false` for occasion-based collections.
4. Add `iconImage` and `bannerImage` paths in the collection object.
5. Use `items` for a normal duʿā list, or `categories` for grouped collections like Weather-Related Duʿās.
